There are two types of bus
- Compilation error: which occurs when the program is compliling, which means that the code doesn't go to production, so it's generally better
- And the **Run time** errors which occur when the script is runnign 
Compilation languages has advantage because you could see error before the code start to run, so this way you could avoid **run time errors**.
